### About me!

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I'm a Software Engineer from Medellín, Colombia, I love everything related to software development, new technologies, design patterns, and software architecture. 12+ years of experience working as a developer, technical leader, and software architect mostly with Microsoft technologies. I'm also co-author and lead contributor of <a href="https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Simmy" target="_blank">Simmy</a> and a co-organizer of <a href="http://mdedotnet.co" target="_blank">MDE.NET community</a>, which is a community for .NET developers in Medellín. I just want to share my experience and put my two cents to the community as well as learn more from the community too, because I think teaching is the best way to learn!
